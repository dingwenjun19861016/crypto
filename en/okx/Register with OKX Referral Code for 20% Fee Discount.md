## ✅ Bitcoin’s Historical Pattern: Every Crash Leads to a Rebound

From the 2011 Mt.Gox hack to the 2020 COVID crisis, the 2022 FTX collapse, and the 2025 “Trump Tariff Shock”—Bitcoin has endured over a dozen major corrections.

And every time, it came back stronger.  
Bitcoin’s long-term logic, scarcity, and growing institutional adoption remain its foundational pillars.

## 💥 The Nature of Altcoins: Pump and Dump, No Continuity

Unlike Bitcoin, altcoins often follow BTC's downtrend, then rebound even harder.  
Short-term gains can surpass BTC during the bounce.

But here's the catch:  
> **Most altcoin rebounds are just a “last gasp”** — lacking sustainability or real fundamental value.

The smarter approach:  
- **Accumulate during dips** (small test positions)  
- **Take profits during rebounds—don’t get greedy**
